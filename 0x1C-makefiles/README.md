# C - Makefiles
This project is a build automation tool called "Make" and provides an introduction to Makefiles.

Makefiles are text files that contain instructions (rules) for building targets.

The purpose of this project is to provide a comprehensive guide to using Make and Makefiles, covering topics such as rules, variables, explicit and implicit rules, and common/useful rules.
